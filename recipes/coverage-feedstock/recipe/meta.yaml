  summary: 'Code coverage measurement for Python'
  
  description: |
    Coverage.py is a tool for measuring code coverage of Python programs. It
    monitors your program, noting which parts of the code have been executed,
    then analyzes the source to identify code that could have been executed
    but was not. Coverage measurement is typically used to gauge the
    effectiveness of tests. It can show which parts of your code are being
    exercised by tests, and which are not.
